# CS4280 Programming Translation Project -- P3:
- Cloned all source files from P2
- Implementing static semantics that can be processed by the compiler
- A variable has to be defined anywhere in the program to be used, before or after its use. Can be reused in another scope. 
         
## Testing
  

## HOW TO RUN: 
1. Compile P2 with: make 
2. To test out the good inputs, please make sure to include the directory:
	- Option 1: ./P2 
	- Option 2: ./P2  
3. To test out the bad inputs, do the same as above: 
	- Option 1: ./P2 
	- Option 2: ./P2
